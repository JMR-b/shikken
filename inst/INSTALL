If you are reading this file, I'm assuming that you have downloaded the source
version of this package that you want to customize and install.

If you do not want to customize/tweak the install, simply install this package
in "the usual way" using R's installation mechanisms (via CRAN). In an R
workspace:

    R> install.packages('shikken')

Customizing a shikken Install Using a Source Package
====================================================
There are two alternatives for installing this package. 

1. Simple installation: Installs the version of the shogun-toolbox that is
   included in this package under src/shogun.
   
     R CMD INSTALL shikken-<version>.tar.gz

2. Installing the package against a previously installed version of libshogun.
   
   You will need to have already successfully compiled and installed the
   `libshogun` interface to the shogun-toolbox, ie:
   
     $ cd /path/to/shogun-toolbox/src
     $ ./configure --interfaces=libshugn
     $ make -j4 && make install
   
   If you installed libshogun without too much fan fare, it would have
   installed the compiled library to DIR/lib/libshogun.xxx and the
   header files should be in DIR/include/shogun, where DIR=/usr/local.
   
   Note that DIR is assumed to contain a `lib` and `include` directory where
   the libshogun.xxx and shogun/headers.h reside.
   
   Let's assume your value for DIR is /usr/local (its default value), then
   you can then compile shikken against your own version of libshogun like so:
   
     $ R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=--with-shogun-dir=DIR \
                     shikken-<version>.tar.gz
