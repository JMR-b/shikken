* Install shogun r_modular library and build some tests against that.

* To enable use of system install of shogun, ensure that the include path (-I)
  finds those header files when compiling the shikken C++ code.
  
  This may require moving src/shogun back to inst/include/shogun. Then add
  -I../inst/include and -I../inst/include/shogun to PKG_CXXFLAGS when compiling
  our bundled shogun-toolbox (ie. WITH_SHOGUN is not defined), otherwise add
  -I$(WITH_SHOGUN)/include to PKG_CXXFLAGS and add -L$(WITH_SHOGUN)/lib and
  -lshogun in the right places.
