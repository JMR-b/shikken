* Stick params for each object in an obj@params slot? Or do we
  put it into the obj@cache$params?
  
  Implement params(obj) in a meaningful way.
  
  Use params(features) to create a new Features object from "raw" data that
  has the same params as the feature object you are trying to mimic.

* Install shogun r_modular library and build some tests against that.
