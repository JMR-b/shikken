Title: An S4 interface to the shogun toolbox.
Version: 0.10.0-1
Author: Steve Lianoglou
Maintainer: Steve Lianoglou <slianoglou@gmail.com>
Description: The shikken library provides an idiomatic S4 interface to
  version 0.11.0 of the shogun toolbox. The shogun toolbox is a machine
  learning library with a focus on large scale kernel methods.
  .
  This library does not use SWIG. As a result, there is likely functionality
  missing from this interface that is available in the "full" shogun toolbox.
  The shogun toolbox provides its own R interfaces (r and r_modular) which you
  can try if there is some functionality in shogun that you require and is
  missing from this library.
  .
  The shogun toolbox is licensed under the GPLv3 with the exception of
  some files from svmlight, which are copyright Torsten Joachimns and are
  licensed separately. Please see the LICENSE.SVMlight file for further
  information.
