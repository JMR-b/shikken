Title: An S4 interface to the Shogun machine learning toolbox.
Version: 0.11.0-1
Author: Steve Lianoglou
Maintainer: Steve Lianoglou <slianoglou@gmail.com>
Description: An R (S4) interface to the shogun toolbox -- a machine learning
  library with a focus on large scale kernel methods.
  .
  This library currently only provides a more R-idiomatic wrapper to shogun's
  r_static interface. This will eventually either switch to the r_modular
  interface for improved functionality, or will be a direct wrapper to the
  libshogun library.
  .
  These libraries are licensed under the GPLv3 with the exception of
  some files from svmlight, which are copyright Torsten Joachimns and are
  licensed separately. Please see the LICENSE.SVMlight file for further
  information.
