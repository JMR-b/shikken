Description: An R (S4) interface to the shogun toolbox -- a machine learning
  library with a focus on large scale kernel methods.
  .
  This library provides an alternative to the r and r_modular interfaces
  already provided by shogun to access its features in R. This package provides
  a more (R) idiomatic interface to the shogun-toolbox functionality that makes
  its use more accessible to (i) the R journeyman; and/or (ii) someone who
  is not well versed in the particulars of shogun's API already.
  .
  Note that if there is no precompiled version of this library available for
  your platform, it is likely because the automated build system is not
  able to build the version of the shogun-toolbox that is included with this
  package. If you download the source package, there are detailed instructions
  on how to build shikken and the shogun-toolbox on your system located in
  the inst/INSTALL file.
