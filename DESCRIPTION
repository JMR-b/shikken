Title: An S4 interface to the shogun (machine learning) toolbox.
Version: 0.11.0-1
Author: Steve Lianoglou
Maintainer: Steve Lianoglou <slianoglou@gmail.com>
Description: An R (S4) interface to the shogun toolbox -- a machine learning
  library with a focus on large scale kernel methods.
  .
  This library provides an alternative to the r and r_modular interfaces
  already provided by shogun to access its features in R. This package aims
  to provide a more (R) idiomatic interface to shogun's methods so that it
  is more accessible to (i) the R journeyman; and/or (ii) someone who is not
  well versed in shogun's API already.
  .
  The shogun toolbox is licensed under the GPLv3 with the exception of
  some files from svmlight, which are copyright Torsten Joachimns and are
  licensed separately. Please see the LICENSE.SVMlight file for further
  information.
