## TODO: Add support for shogun (internal) cross validation

## Add support for shogun-toolbox (internal) cross validation.
## Add a predetermined splitting strategy that inherits from
## shogun/evaluation/SplittingStrategy that allows the R user to gnereate
## their own splits. This will create a C object that is passed into the
## CrossValidation object as the SplittingStrategy
