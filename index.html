title: shikken &mdash; An R library to interface with the shogun-toolbox
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>shikken is a library for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a> that provides an interface to the <a href="http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/">shogun-toolbox</a>, a C++ library for "large scale" machine learning.</p>

<p>Although the shogun-toolbox already provides the (i) <code><a href="http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/r_examples.html">r_static</a></code> interface, and the (ii) <code><a href="http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/r_modular_examples.html">r_module</a></code> interface you can use from R, the API of these libraries are more consistent with "the shogun API" than they are to "idiomatic R". There are other (minor) disadvantages these libraries have, as well. For instance, the <code>r_static</code> interface can only work with one "shogun machine" at a time, and the <code>r_modular</code> library is currently in its alpha stage, and relies on <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, which still has <a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc2.0/R.html">a few problems working with R</a>.
  
<p>The goal of the <a href="https://github.com/lianos/shikken">shikken library</a> is to provide a full featured interface to the shogun-toolbox that fits "more naturally" within R, thereby making the shogun-toolbox more accessible to the R community at large. It is programmed against the core <a href="http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/libshogun_examples.html">libshogun C++ library</a>, so it will (overtime) expose all of shogun's functionality while attempting to sidestep some of the disadvantages the <code>r_static</code> and <code>r_modular</code> interfaces have. In the future, I plan on packaging shogun's <code>src/libshogun</code> code with this package and making it a "self installable unit" easily installable through the "normal R channels", eg. <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
  
<p>building a 2-class SVM for the iris dataset works like so:
  <pre>
  > library(shikken)
  > iris.sub <- subset(iris, Species != "virginica")
  > svm <- SVM(Species ~ ., data=iris.sub)
  > table(predict(svm), iris.sub$Species)
  
          setosa versicolor virginica
    -1         0         50         0
     1        50          0         0
  </pre>
  (note that the labels are turned to -1/1 internally and are shown as such in the left column)
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>In order to install this package, you currently have to install the <code>libshogun</code> interface on your system separately (first). You can find more information on its <a href="https://github.com/lianos/shikken/wiki">wiki pages</a>.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>This library is in its early stages of development (started ~ June 20, 2011), and isn't quite ready for public consumption just yet. I am currently focussing on exposing more of the "vanilla" SVM functionality (ie. linear, gaussian, polynomial, and custom kernels), specifically in the 2-class classification setting. I actually started this project because I wanted to get access to shogun's string kernel functionality, so that will be coming up next.</p>


<p>My C++ is rather rusty. I'm using <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html">Rcpp</a> to help with the R &lt; &mdash; &gt; C bridge code. The quality of that code will evolve (for the better!) as I get my C++ shoes back. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the code, I'm all ears.</p>

<p>The design of this package has been influenced from the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kernlab/index.html">kernlab</a> package, and I've sampled "rather liberally" from some of the code in that package as well. A big thanks goes to the authors of that library.</p>
