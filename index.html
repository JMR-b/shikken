title: shikken &mdash; An R library to interface with the shogun-toolbox
---

<p>shikken is a library for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R programming language</a> that provides an interface to the <a href="http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/">shogun-toolbox</a>, a C++ library for "large scale" machine learning. While the shogun-toolbox comes with its own R wrappers, this library is written in a manner that's more idiomatic to R.</p>

<p>
  For instance, building 2-class SVM for the iris dataset works like so:
  <pre>
  > library(shikken)
  > iris.dat <- subset(iris, Species != "virginica")
  > svm <- SVM(Species ~ ., data=iris)
  > table(predict(svm, type='decision'), iris.dat$Species)
  
                       setosa versicolor virginica
            setosa         50          0         0
            versicolor      0         50         0
            virginica       0          0         0
  </pre>
</p>

<p>This library is in its early stages of development (started ~ June 20, 2011), and isn't quite ready for public consumption just yet. You can find more information on its <a href="https://github.com/lianos/shikken/wiki">wiki pages</a>.
