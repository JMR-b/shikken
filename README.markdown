This is an R library that wraps the [shogun toolbox][shogun] in order
to provide a more idiomatic interface to the toolbox through R.

I'm hoping this will sidestep the problem the `r_modular` interface has
which is a result of a non-fully functional [R-swig][Rswig].

The layout of this package is inspired by [RcppArmadillo][armadillo]

DISCLAIMER: This is work in progress, so it's probably not a good idea
for *you* to use it just yet.
